The Kinvey JavaScript SDK Core is a package that can be used to develop JavaScript applications on the Kinvey platform. The Kinvey JavaScript SDK Core is intended to be used as a way to share common code across different JavaScript SDK builds.

The Kinvey JavaScript SDK Core supports several platforms through platform-specific shims. Here is a list of shims we currently support, each as a separate repo -

* [Angular](https://github.com/Kinvey/angular-sdk)
* [Angular 2](https://github.com/Kinvey/angular2-sdk)
* [Backbone](https://github.com/Kinvey/backbone-sdk)
* [HTML5](https://github.com/Kinvey/html5-sdk)
* [Node](https://github.com/Kinvey/kinvey-nodejs)
* [PhoneGap](https://github.com/Kinvey/phonegap-sdk)
